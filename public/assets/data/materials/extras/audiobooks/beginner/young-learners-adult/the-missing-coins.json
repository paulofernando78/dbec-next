'The girl went to the window with the coins!' 'But there were people in the street,' Pete says. 'Yes, perhaps people watched her,' Carla says, 'but the coins went into the flute player's hat! The coins were valuable, but the people in the street didn't know that.' 'The girl and the flute player were very clever!' Pete says. 'But now they're coming with me to the police station,' the policeman says. He takes the coins from the flute player. After some time, a police car arrives. It takes the girl and the flute player to the police station."
