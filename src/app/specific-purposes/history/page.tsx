            Did the V-2 rocket ever work? V-2 Missile | National Air and Space
            Museum The V-2 was to be an even more decisive terror weapon, but
            the rocket was neither accurate, reliable, nor cost effective. On 7
            September 1944 the first two operational rockets were fired against
            Paris, but both failed due to premature cutoffs.

        <p>What is the difference between right-wing and left-wing?</p>


        <p>Generally, the left wing is characterized by an emphasis on "ideas such as freedom, equality, fraternity, rights, progress, reform and internationalism" while the right wing is characterized by an emphasis on "notions such as authority, hierarchy, order, duty, tradition, reaction and nationalism".</p>
