              Experts say a Chinese rocket that recently helped launch 18
              satellites broke apart in space and created hundreds of pieces of
              debris.

              Space traffic observation organizations said data showed part of a
              Chinese rocket came apart soon after making the satellite
              deployments. State media in China reported the satellites were
              carried to space aboard a Long March-6 rocket and reached orbit on
              August 6.

              world. Such satellites operate from between 300 and 2,000
              kilometers above Earth. The area is known as low Earth orbit.

              traffic said the Chinese rocket stage that broke apart in space
              created at least 700 pieces of debris. The floating debris is also
              known as space junk. It can harm active spacecraft, other

              In 2022, a Long March 6A rocket stage similarly broke apart in
              space and created hundreds of pieces of debris. That event led to
